    "\n",
    "Graph Neural Networks (GNN), as a methodology of learning representations on graphs, has gained much attention recently.  Various models such as Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE, etc. are proposed to obtain representations of whole graphs, or nodes on a single graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary goal of Collaborative Filtering (CF) is to automatically make predictions about a user's interest, e.g. whether/how a user would interact with a set of items, given the interaction history of the user herself, as well as the histories of other users.  The user-item interaction can also be viewed as a bipartite graph, where users and items form two sets of nodes, and edges connecting them stands for interactions.  The problem can then be formulated as a *link-prediction* problem, where we try to predict whether an edge (of a given type) exists between two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this intuition, the academia developed multiple new models for CF, including but not limited to:\n",

    "* Graph-convolutional Approaches\n",
